    - npm creat vite@latest
    - npm install or npm i
    - npm run build

#### Folder Structure:
- Package.json - it contains the metadata of the project like project name, version, discriptions etc.
- Package-lock.json - it lock the versions of packages and dependencies which give consistancy to build the env.
