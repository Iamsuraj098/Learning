## Merge Sort

It follow the Divide and Conqure approach.

Time Complexity - O(n*log(n))

Sort function -

It break the arr index wise till start < end case failed. in the mean which merge function called.

Merge Function -

left = mid- - start + 1

right = end - mid

create the left array and right array.

Now use while loop compare until i < left and j < right, inside the loop we compare the left[i] and right[j] and store in arr[k]

Store remaining left and right array in arr.
