### Dependency Injection

##### Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which one object (called a dependency) is provided to another object rather than the object creating the dependency itself. In Dependency injection we pass the object

### Why Use Dependency Injection?

- Loose coupling between classes.
- Easier testing (mocking dependencies).
- Cleaner, more maintainable code.
- Makes the system extensible and scalable.
