### Annotation

#### There are annotations which frequently used: 
1. @Component
 
    It's a class level annotation.
    Spring creates an object of that class (a bean) and puts it into the ApplicationContext.
    Now we have to not create the object of that class, its automatically created.
2. @Beam
3. @Configuration
4. @Controller
5. @RestController
6. @Service
7. @Repository
